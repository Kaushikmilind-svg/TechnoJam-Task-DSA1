# TechnoJam-Task
# DSA
This is a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project! In this project, I've implemented basic DSA concepts and solutions to given problems.
# About Me
I am Milind Kaushik. I am CSE 1st Year student from Delhi. I like to learn programming languages. I can code in Python and know some basic Java. I am currently learning Web development.

# About Task
I did the tasks in Python language because it's easy and has simple syntax. The only problem I faced was in the disc task (Medium#1).
